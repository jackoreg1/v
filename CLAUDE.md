# CLAUDE.md

Notes for Claude working in this repo. Jack usually works from his phone, so
the point of this file is that Claude does not have to ask him things he would
have to answer with his thumbs.

## What this repo is

Two standalone, self-contained HTML pages. That is the whole repo.

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `vision-k7x9q2.html` | Jack's "vision build" of jackoregan.com, written as if it is August 2027. Home page, weekly post, Leak Finder quiz, the EUR 29 book sales page, an interactive reader for the book, the EUR 999 assessment funnel, and a funnel map. |
| `movienight.html` | A trailer-rating app. 61 films, score each 1-10, anything 7+ is kept on a shortlist that survives refreshes. |

## Hard rules

- **One file per page. Everything inline.** CSS in a single `<style>`, JS in a
  single `<script>`, no imports, no bundler, no framework, no external assets.
  A page must work by double-tapping the file with no network.
- **No dependencies and no build step.** Do not add npm, a package.json, a
  config file, or a toolchain. If a change seems to need one, the change is
  wrong.
- **No tracking, no analytics, no third-party scripts.** `vision-k7x9q2.html`
  is deliberately `noindex,nofollow`.
- **Mobile first.** Both pages are designed to be used on a phone. Check any
  layout change at a narrow width before a wide one.
- **Do not "fix" the 2027 numbers.** The dates, the EUR 214,000, the 61
  assessments, the 1,100 copies, the testimonials and the follower count in
  `vision-k7x9q2.html` are a deliberate vision build set in the future. They
  are not claims about today and they are not bugs. Leave them unless Jack
  says otherwise.

## Voice

Jack's copy has a specific voice and it is easy to wreck. Match it:

- Irish, spoken, plain. "the fella ranking first", "grand", "aye", "on the
  tools", "before the dinner".
- Short sentences. Comma splices are fine and used on purpose.
- **No em dashes.** There are none in either file. Do not introduce any.
- Numbers do the persuading, not adjectives. Every claim carries a figure.
- Never inflate. The book itself argues for the honesty cap and the mean
  0.1 multiplier. Copy that goes the other way is off-voice.

## How each page actually works

### `vision-k7x9q2.html`

- **Routing is the URL hash.** `SCREENS` lists the valid ids; `go(id)` sets
  `location.hash`, `route()` toggles `.screen.on` for `#s-<id>`. An unknown
  hash falls back to `home`. Adding a screen means adding a `<div class="screen"
  id="s-x">` *and* adding `"x"` to `SCREENS`.
- **Nothing persists.** No `localStorage` anywhere. `bought` is a plain
  variable, so a refresh re-locks the book. That is intentional for a demo.
- **The book paywall** is the `.locked` class. `readerRefresh()` shows or
  hides every `.locked` page and flips `#lockpanel` / `#ownedline`. A new
  paid page needs `class="bookpage locked"`.
- **The interactive book maths** runs off `calcBook()`, wired by
  `oninput` on each input. Ids are load-bearing: `bk-aj` and `bk-jw` are the
  two base numbers, `bk-l1` to `bk-l9` are the per-leak inputs, and each one
  writes into the scoreboard cell with the matching `sb-l1`..`sb-l9` id.
  Leak 10 is deliberately not counted, it rolls up into leak 7.
  The 15 percent honesty cap is computed in `calcBook()` and written to
  `#bk-capmsg`.
- **The quiz** is the `QUIZ` array. Each entry is `{cat, q, opts}` and each
  option is `[label, weight]` in euro per month. The last question, `cat:"size"`,
  is different: its weight is a multiplier, not a weight, and answering it
  jumps straight to the email capture. Result = sum of weights x multiplier,
  rounded to the nearest 10.
- **The green is `#0e6b45`** throughout, with `#0a5636` for hover. Use the
  existing CSS classes rather than adding new ones where one already fits.

### `movienight.html`

- **The film list is `F`**, an array of
  `[title, runtimeMinutes, blurb, "Comma,Separated,Tags", youtubeId]`.
  Adding a film means appending one row, nothing else.
- **State persists** in `localStorage` under the key `movienight1`, shaped
  `{seen: [], short: [{n, s}], bin: []}` where `n` is the index into `F`.
  Changing the shape of `F` or reordering it invalidates saved state, so if the
  order ever has to change, change `KEY` too.
- A round is 15 unseen, unbinned films, shuffled. A score of 7 or more puts
  the film on the shortlist. The shortlist survives every new round.
- Dark theme, colours are the `:root` custom properties. `--amber` is the
  accent, `--red` is the trailer button only.

## Previewing on a phone

The pages are full HTML documents, so they cannot be published as an Artifact
as-is. `scripts/build-artifact.py` strips the document wrapper into a
publishable body and writes it to `build/`:

```
python3 scripts/build-artifact.py movienight.html
```

Then publish `build/movienight.artifact.html` with the Artifact tool. Re-run
the script and re-publish the same path to update the same link.

`build/` is generated. Never edit anything in it, and never treat it as the
source of truth.

## Working with Jack

- He is usually on a phone. Keep replies short, lead with what changed, and do
  not paste long code blocks he has to scroll.
- Commit and push to the working branch as you go rather than saving it all up.
- If a change is visual, build and publish the artifact so he can look at it
  instead of reading a diff.
